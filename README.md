> ### Power Puff Canvas Game

One of my final projects was to make a game. This game uses canvas and Javascript for the player to eat apples as they float across the screen. The more you eat, the faster they come. Levels get progressively harder and you only have 3 misses.

The tech it uses includes:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
